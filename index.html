        <p class="paragraph">I have just recently completed this series called <i>Vikings</i>.<br />
            Vikings is inspired by the sagas of <b> <i>Ragnar Lothbrok</i></b>, a Viking who is one of the best-known
            legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of Anglo-Saxon England and West Francia. The show
            portrays Ragnar as a farmer from the Kattegat who rises to fame by raiding England and eventually becomes a
            Scandinavian king, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series
            follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia, Kievan Rus', the
            Mediterranean and North America.</p>

        <p>Ragnar is married to the popular and most powerful shield-maiden in the world, <i>Lagertha</i>.<br />
            They have a son called, <i>Bjorn</i>, who is extremely eager to join his father in raiding, but the young
            boy is only 13 years old
            as at the time season 1 starts. <i>Ragnar</i> has a brother called, <i>Rollo</i>, who betrays him several
            times, despite that, <i>Ragnar</i>
            kept forgiving him.
            As the series progresses, we see Ragnar raiding distant lands and coming back to tgheir home town in Norway
            called
            Kattegat.
            Ragnar's bestfriend and boat builder, Floki sails on all of Ragnar's adventures along with other Vikings and
            Shield
            Maidens. The sons of Ragnar all grow up to be great men and even outdo their father in feats.<br /></p>
